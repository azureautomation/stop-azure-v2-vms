Stop Azure V2 VMs
=================

            

DESCRIPTION

This runbook connects to Azure using system assigned identity and starts all V2 VMs in an Azure subscription or resource group or a single named V2 VM.

You can attach a recurring schedule to this runbook to run it at a specific time.

REQUIRED

1. An Automation Account system assigned identity with at least Virtual Machine Contributor permission on the VM’s, resource group, or the subscription. To use a User assigned identity you can pass the Account ID as a parameter.

2. The subscription ID of the VM’s.

OPTIONAL

3. A ResourceGroupName input parameter value that allows scoping the V2 VMs to a particular resource group.

4. A VMName input parameter that allows specification of a single V2 VM.

NOTES
- Link Conditions to determine how to get the VMs -Following the 'Connect to Azure' activity there are three sequence links that have conditions set. These conditions are mutually exclusive and will direct the workflow to only one of the connected activities to get VMs.
- Merge VMs activity -The 'Merge VMs' activity is used to merge the output of the immediately preceding activities.  By merging the output into a single activity, which then re-outputs the objects, the downstream activities, like 'Start VM' are able to refer to a single activity for input data.  At design time, we don't know which of the immediately preceding activities will run, so 'Start VM' doesn't know which activity to refer to for input data.  By creating 'Merge VMs', 'Start VM' has a single activity to refer to for input.

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
